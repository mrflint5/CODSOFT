ðŸ“Œ CODSOFT Internship Projects ðŸš€
ðŸŽ¬ Project 1: Movie Genre Classification
Build a machine learning model to predict a movieâ€™s genre from its plot summary or textual details using TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM. (Data collected from Kaggle) ðŸ“‚

ðŸ’³ Project 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Develop a model to identify fraudulent transactions from credit card data. Test algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. (Dataset collected from Kaggle â€” update CSV path for macOS) ðŸ“‚

ðŸ“‰ Project 3: Customer Churn Prediction
Predict whether a customer will leave a subscription-based service using historical data such as usage behavior and demographics. Apply algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting for accurate predictions. (Data collected from Kaggle) ðŸ“‚

ðŸ“² Project 4: Spam SMS Detection
Create an AI model that classifies SMS messages as spam or ham using TF-IDF or word embeddings with models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM to ensure safe and clean communication. (Data collected from Kaggle) ðŸ“‚
